### 🧑‍💼 About Me

I'm a **Python Backend Engineer** with hands-on experience in designing scalable, modular systems for data automation and cloud deployment.

* 🛠️ Developed a robust **ETL pipeline** for automated extraction of **Walmart reports**, transforming and loading data into **Google Sheets** and a **PostgreSQL database** using raw SQL queries.
* 🧱 Built the backend following **Clean Architecture principles**, ensuring clear separation between business logic and infrastructure for maintainability and testability.
* 🔁 Created configurable and **reusable ETL modules**, enabling seamless integration of new data sources and workflows with minimal code changes.
* ⚡ Implemented **Redis caching** and **asynchronous processing**, reducing API overhead and improving performance by **30%**.
* 📦 Containerized the application with **Docker** and deployed it via **AWS Lambda**, achieving serverless, cost-efficient execution.
* ✅ Achieved **90%+ test coverage** using **Pytest**, integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous quality control.

I'm also proficient in writing automated tests in **Python** and **Java**, covering **API**, **UI**, and **integration levels** using **Selenium**, **Playwright**, and **Allure reporting**.
